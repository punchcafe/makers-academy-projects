### Instructions

#### Setup Database

- `createdb MakersBnB` and enter the database environment with `psql MakersBnB`;

- `createdb MakersBnB-test` for test dastabase;

- Run the script documented in `db/migrations/` in `psql`:

```
DROP TABLE spaces;

CREATE TABLE spaces (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  space_name TEXT,
  description TEXT,
  price DECIMAL(10, 2)
);
```

Note that `psql` will throw an error on `DROP TABLE`
when you first setup `space` table as the `space` table does not exist.
